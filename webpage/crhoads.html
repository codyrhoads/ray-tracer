		<br>
		<br>
		For my final feature I chose to implement ambient occlusion. I wanted to add
		 some feature that added more realism to shading; in particular, I felt that 
		 intersecting objects were lacking in the realism department. There wasn't 
		 any indication of a transition between the two objects. AO helped to fix 
		 that issue by darkening the area where the objects intersect.
		<br>
		<br>

		I only used the provided notes on ambient occlusion, as well as previous
		knowledge about the method of implementing Monte Carlo global illumination.

		<font size=+3><strong>Software Design Implementation</strong></font>
		<br>
		<br>
		When first starting the project, I had each object calculating its own
		shading. However, it quickly became apparent that this was incredibly
		redundant and inefficient. This led to the creation of the Shader.cpp class,
		which handled shading based on a given ray.
		<br>
		<br>
		The primary method in Shader is getShadedColor(), a recursive method that,
		as the name implies, returns the shaded color of whatever the ray intersected.
		As features such as reflectance, refraction, and global illumination were
		added, this method became dense and unorganized.
		<br>
		<br>
		To fix this issue, I extracted the implementations of these features into other
		methods within Shader. Thanks to these methods, getShadedColor() is much easier
		to read. Instead of having to decipher the implementations of features such as
		Monte Carlo global illumination or Blinn Phong, they are abstracted into
		appropriately-named methods like findAmbientMonteCarlo() and
		findLocalColorBlinnPhong(). This greatly enhances the legibility, and in turn
		the quality, of the class as a whole.
