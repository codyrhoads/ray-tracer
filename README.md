# ray-tracer

## Parsing
Parses Camera, Lights, Spheres, and Planes correctly. Comments are ignored. Ignores object transforms for now.

## Rendering
planes.pov currently has lighting issues. Otherwise, images render fine with Blinn-Phong.

Alternate rendering technique is not complete yet.

## Diagnostic/Testing
All test commands (sceneinfo, pixelray, firsthit, pixelcolor) are functioning as intended.
