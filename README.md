# ray-tracer

## Parsing
Parses Camera, Lights, Spheres, Planes, and Triangles correctly. Comments are ignored. Ignores object transforms for now.

## Rendering
Images render fine with Blinn-Phong and Cook-Torrance. Reflectance and Refraction are functioning properly. Schlick's Approximation and Beer's Law are implemented.

## Diagnostic/Testing
Most test commands (sceneinfo, pixelray, firsthit, pixelcolor) are functioning as intended.
